                <h2>Language</h2>
                <p>
                    The Front-End Nanodegree program primarily utilizes three core languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    These languages form the foundation of web development and are essential for creating engaging and
                    interactive user interfaces.

                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for structuring web pages. It
                    provides a set of tags and elements that define the content and layout of a webpage. HTML is
                    responsible for creating the basic structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
                    images, and links.

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and
                    appearance of a document written in HTML. It allows developers to control the visual aspects of a
                    webpage, including colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. CSS enables the customization and styling
                    of HTML elements to create visually appealing and responsive web designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactivity and functionality to web pages.
                    It enables developers to create dynamic and interactive elements, handle user interactions,
                    manipulate data, and communicate with servers. JavaScript is widely used for implementing various
                    features such as form validation, event handling, dynamic content updates, and complex user
                    interfaces.

                    Throughout the Front-End Nanodegree program, you will gain a solid understanding of these languages
                    and their respective frameworks and libraries. You will learn how to effectively combine HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript to build responsive and user-friendly web applications. By mastering these languages,
                    you will be equipped with the fundamental skills necessary to create compelling front-end
                    experiences and launch a successful career in web development.
